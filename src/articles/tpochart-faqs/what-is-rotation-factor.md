Rotation Factor - Each letter is given a +1 if it's high is above high of previous letter, and a -1 if it's high is below high of previous letter. In addition, a +1 or -1 is added based on whether the low was above or below the previous low. Each letters RF (anywhere from -2 to +2) is summed to provide the RF of the profile.
