  bars
order: 15
---
On the indicator properties set "01: Show Bars" = True



Then to configure the normal chart bars to plot above the profiles you need to change the Z Order of the bars, to do it:



Make sure the bars are selectable, got to chart properties (Ctrl-T) and set "Allow the selection or drag/drop of chart series" = true



Select the bars by click on them



Use the Shift and Mouse scroll wheel to change the bars Z order until they plot above the graphics
