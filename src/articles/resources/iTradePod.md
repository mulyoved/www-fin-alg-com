excellence by providing invaluable [market data](http://www.itradepod.com/Clients), [education](http://www.itradepod.com/education),
training and trading experience for traders by traders. The iTradePod approach allows traders to learn and apply the time tested concepts of Auction Market Theory, Market ProfileÂ® and Order Flow; one of the few reliable methods that consistently and objectively describe the state of the market across all time frames.
