# Delta Divergence & Accumulated Delta

Delta describe the net difference between the buying and selling entering the market. It is calculated by subtracting the volume transacted at the bid price from the volume transacted at the ask price. Trades that occur at the ask price are trades that initiated by aggressive buyers. Trades that occur at the bid price are considered to be initiated by aggressive sellers. Thus, a positive delta would reflect more aggressive buying as the result of motivated buyers lifting the ask. A negative delta would reflect more aggressive selling as the result of motivated sellers hitting the bid. Delta Divergence Indicator show the delta of each bar as Histogram Accumulated Delta show the development of delta over the session or between sessions.
