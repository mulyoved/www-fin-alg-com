## 4. Important Note

MarketBalance operates within the real-time NinjaTrader environment.

NinjaTrader does not save price Bid/Ask volume data to its database, therefore this history is not accessible for MarketBalance to load. So, MarketBalance

also functions on real-time data and does not plot any values for historical data. Data will only be captured within MarketBalance when NinjaTrader is open and connected to a real-time feed.

This also means that if any chart interval or indicator parameter (except as mentioned below in 6. Features > Selection Methods) is changed, then any accumulated real-time plots wil be lost. It is suggested, that after experimentation to get the desired MarketBalance parameter setup, a template is saved.

## 5. History - Future

Sometime soon after the next major release of Ninjatrader (v6.5), scheduled for late fal 2007, it may be possible that MarketBalance wil offer limited re-loadable History based on a modified use of the Market Replay Recorder facility.



## 6. Features Description

Here are descriptions of the main MarketBalance features.

### Delta Calculation

Delta is defined as the difference between the Buying volume and the Selling volume.

There are two ways it can be calculated:

**Bid/Ask** – Delta can be calculated based on trades occurring at Bid or Ask, as fol ows:

1. If trade at Ask then trade direction is up & Volume = Buy.

2. If trade at Bid then trade direction is down & Volume = Sel .

**Up Tick/Down Tick** - Delta can be calculated based on price continuing to tick up or down, as fol ows:



1. If Ask > Last Ask then trade direction is up & Volume = Buy.

2. If Bid < Last Bid then trade direction is down & Volume = Sel Else Volume = last trade direction.

### Action Bar

The Action Bar is an optional bar that can be displayed to the right of the last normal chart bar and that can be run by a set of rules independently from the main MarketBalance Bars of the chart.

It can be displayed in any of the MarketBalance Views as described below. .

It has two rule sets that are unique to it, as follows:

![Action Bar](./Page-3-Image-1.png)

**Pullback** – in Pull back mode, the Action Bar is reset every time the current MarketBalance bar makes a new high or low. If price continues to tick lower the Action Bar wil be reset at each new low. Then as price moves off the low, the Action Bar wil build, so showing the conviction of buyers to drive price away from the low. In this scenario, the Action Bar wil continue to build until:

1. The low is broken again

2. A new (bar) high is made

3. Or a new bar is started on the chart

Any of these events wil cause the Action Bar to be reset.

**Continuation Bar** – in Continuation mode, the Action Bar wil display the last x price levels (default of 5) independently of the current MarketBalance bar. It wil maintain a constant number of price levels, so if price is ticking up, the Action Bar wil move up to the new high and its previous lowest price wil be dropped. Thus the Action Bar wil ‘slide’ up and down the current bar showing the immediate volume at each level of price action.

The Action Bar wil continue to build until:

1. Price ticks above its current high, when its lowest price will be dropped.

2. Price ticks below its current low, then its highest price wil be dropped.

In Continuation mode the Action Bar will not be reset with each new MarketBalance bar.

Because it does not reset with each new bar, it is possible to use this mode of the Action Bar to capture longer term Accumulation or Distribution. By changing the default setting for say ES, to 12 (3 points) a much clearer view of what is happening during periods of consolidation can be gained.



In situations where price might be rotating in a fairly narrow range a setting ES of 12 (or larger if preferred) for ES as an example, can show in a single bar that might cover 2 - 3 hours, what the building market condition is. That in turn may communicate what the likely breakout direction could be.



Experiment with settings using either live data or Market Replay to gain an understanding of larger Continuation Bar setting may be used.

### MarketBalance Views

There are 7 different ways to View the MarketBalance bar. In each View, individual prices are color graduated based on either higher or lower volume or delta;

**Bid x Ask** – displays the trades occurring at the Bid and Ask at each price point within the MarketBalance bar. The Highest Volume price has a heavier box outline.

![Bid x Ask](./Page-4-Image-2.png)

**Bid/Ask Ladder** – displays to the Bid x Ask except more compact and where the side that has the Highest Volume is colored and bolded to highlight it to al ow for quick visual identification of directional price runs. The Highest Volume price has a heavier box outline on either the Bid or Ask side of the ladder.

![Bid/Ask Ladder](./Page-4-Image-3.png)





**Delta** – displays the net of Sel – Buy volume transactions at each price. The Highest Delta price has a heavier box outline.

![Delta](./Page-5-Image-4.png)


**Graduated Volume** – displays the volume at each price color graduated to al ow for easy visual differentiation lower and higher volume prices. The Highest Volume price has a heavier box outline.

![Graduated Volume](./Page-5-Image-5.png)

**Delta Colored Volume** – displays the volume at each price colored graduated by higher or lower Delta. The Highest Volume price has a heavier box outline.

![Delta Colored Volume](./Page-5-Image-6.png)

**High/Low Volume** – displays the volume at each price with just the regions of high(er) and low(er) volume colored. The Highest Volume price has a heavier box outline.

![High/Low Volume](./Page-5-Image-7.png)

**Volume Histogram** – displays the volume at each price as a Histogram with coloring graduated by higher or lower Delta. The Highest Volume price has a heavier box outline.

![Volume Histogram](./Page-6-Image-8.png)

### Highest Volume Highlight

For every Action Bar and MarketBalance bar, regardless of View, the price with the highest volume (or delta for the Delta view) is highlighted with a heavier surround box.

### Information Totals

There are two sets of totals displays available within MarketBalance, on the left side and at the bottom of the chart.

**Left Side** – has 3 elements

* Price ladder

* Volume total at each price level

* Volume Histogram with volume at Ask and Bid color splits

Any combination or al of these can be displayed.

![Volume Histogram with volume](/./Page-6-Image-9.png)

**Bottom** – has 9 elements and displays totals for each MarketBalance Bar * Ask – total Ask Volume in the bar.

* Bid – total Bid Volume in the bar.

* Delta – the difference between Ask and Bid volume.

* Max Delta – the maximum Delta reached within the bar.

* Min Delta – the minimum Delta reached within the bar.

* Cum Delta – the accumulation of Delta across the session (as set by either Chart properties or within Parameters > Session Times).

* Cum Delta/Cum Volume – a percentage of the overal Delta across the session.

* Volume – the total volume within the bar.

* Cum Volume – the accumulation of volume across the session.

Any combination or al of these can be displayed. Al but Max and Min Delta are also displayed for the Action Bar.

![Cum Volume](/./Page-7-Image-10.png)

### Selection Methods

There 3 ways available to select Action Bar and MarketBalance View type and the Information Totals;

**Parameters** – normal y these would be used to set up the preferred default views, then saved as a template. Note that changing any indicator parameter wil refresh the chart and all accumulated Bid/Ask data will be lost.

![Parameters](/./Page-8-Image-11.png)

**Dropdown Menus** – 3 menus have been added to the toolbar, the first and second al ows View Type selection for the MarketBalance and Actions bars respectively, while the last al ows tick box selection of any or al of the Totals. Note that changing any View or Totals option via the Dropdown menus does not refresh the chart and so accumulated Bid/Ask data is not lost.

![Dropdown Menus](/./Page-9-Image-12.png)

**Right Click Chart Context menu** – once done three options, MarketBalance View Type, Action Bar View Type and Totals will be seen at the top of the menu list.

![Right Click](/./Page-9-Image-13.png)

Note that changing any View or Totals option via the Context menu **does not** refresh the chart and so accumulated Bid/Ask data is **not lost**.

Note that with either of the second two methods changing the MarketBalance View will automaticaly change the Action Bar View as well. Then use the Action Bar menus if a different view is wanted for it.

## MarketBalance Parameters
